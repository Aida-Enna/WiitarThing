# WiitarThing
Lets you use Wii Guitar Hero guitars on PC with high performance (built with Clone Hero in mind).

Built upon [WiinUSoft and WiinUPro's codebase](https://github.com/keypuncher/wiinupro), but not forked because the changes are too significant and messy. 
All credit for connecting Wiimotes in general and most of the UI goes to Justin Keys.
